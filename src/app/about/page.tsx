        <section className="mt-12 space-y-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            I currently work at{" "}
            <span className="font-semibold">InSpark</span>, where I build modern
            cloud-native applications using{" "}
            <span className="font-semibold">.NET, Azure, and React</span>. My
            work often involves automating processes, integrating APIs, and
            deploying solutions that scale in real-world environments.
          </p>

          <p>
            Outside of work, I love creating tools that directly impact the
            people around me. Whether it‚Äôs{" "}
            <span className="italic">a Microsoft Word add-in for Qur‚ÄôƒÅn study</span>,{" "}
            <span className="italic">a custom attendance system for teachers</span>, or{" "}
            <span className="italic">an invoicing bot that helps my dad</span>,
            I find joy in solving problems for my family, community, and faith.
          </p>

          <p>
            My mindset is simple:{" "}
            <span className="font-semibold">
              start small, make it useful, and improve step by step
            </span>
            . This approach has shifted my perspective from being overwhelmed by
            complexity to enjoying the challenge of building systems piece by
            piece.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond coding, I enjoy learning about Islamic history, Arabic, and
            cooking ‚Äî blending technology,
            faith, and family life.
