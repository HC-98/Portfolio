#    - Scenario: GitHub Actions deploying Azure resources
#    - Organization: your-github-username
#    - Repository: your-repo-name
#    - Entity type: Branch
#    - Branch name: main
# 3. Add 3 GitHub Secrets:
#    - AZURE_CLIENT_ID (from app registration)
#    - AZURE_TENANT_ID (from app registration)
#    - AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID (from subscription)
# 4. Assign Contributor role to app on App Service
